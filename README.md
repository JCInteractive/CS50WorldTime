# CS50WorldTime
CS50 Final Project

This is CS50WorldTime! An interactive time tracking tool that lets you track local times around the globe and plan your trips accordingly!
To get started you will need to download Visual Studio. You can download the free community version here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Once you have downloaded Visual Studio, you can clone or download this repository and open the .sln file. Once you have loaded the solution, hit F5 to build and run a local copy!
You can also visit a live version of this app at: http://cs50worldtime.azurewebsites.net

The app is configured to store user data internally but can be run with SQL Server and Entity Framework.

When you first visit the page you will see that it displays your current time zone and time based on the IP address of your computer/device. From the home page you have several options such as checking the time zone of other cities around the globe and even planning a trip! Feel free to register for a local account and sign in. (This feature will not work on the live site as the free tier of azure does not provide database storage access).

Time Zone features are powered by http://worldtimeapi.org/
